A programming language is an artificial language designed
to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly
a computer. Programming languages can be used to create
programs that control the behavior of a machine and/or to
express algorithms precisely.
The earliest programming languages predate the invention
of the computer, and were used to direct the behavior of
machines such as Jacquard looms and player pianos.
Thousands of different programming languages have been
created, mainly in the computer field, with many being
created every year. Most programming languages describe
computation in an imperative style, i.e., as a sequence
of commands, although some languages, such as those that
support functional programming or logic programming, use
alternative forms of description.
The description of a programming language is usually split
into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning).
Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example,
the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard),
while other languages, such as Perl 5 and earlier, have a
dominant implementation that is used as a reference.
The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably
with programming language.However, the usage of both
terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of each.
One usage describes programming languages as a subset
of computer languages.
